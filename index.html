			<h1 id="foe-event-set-builder-how-to-use-">FoE Event Set Builder - How To Use!</h1>
			<h2 id="add-building">Add building</h2>
			<p>To add a building, simply select the set, building, age and level and click the &quot;Add Building&quot;
				button. The building will be added to the scene and you can start building! When selecting a building,
				the stats of the chosen building is displayed, giving you information of what the building gives with
				your current options.</p>
			<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
			<p><strong>Move Building:</strong> Click and drag the building you want to move, drop to stop moving.
				Buildings will automatically snap to the grid and cannot be placed on top of each other. </p>
			<p><strong>Remove Building:</strong> Click the &quot;Remove Building&quot; option under &quot;Current
				Building&quot; to remove the currently selected building - completely removes it from the scene.</p>
			<p><strong>Change Current Building:</strong> Open &quot;Current Building&quot; menu and update age, level
				and whether the building is connected to road (if required), changes are automatically applied. An
				unconnected building will count towards the set bonuses of neighboring buildings, but its own rewards
				will not.</p>
			<p><strong>Zoom:</strong> Use the scroll-wheel to zoom in and out from the grid.</p>
			<p><strong>Move View:</strong> Use Up, Down, Left and Right arrows to move around in the scene.</p>
			<h2 id="production-overview">Production Overview</h2>
			<p>The Production Overview shows you what your current setup will give you per collection. &quot;All
				Sets&quot; will show the total production information of all buildings in your design. &quot;Per
				Set&quot; will only show the production of the chosen set. For each option you can choose between
				&quot;Total&quot; and &quot;Per Tile&quot; production, which show the raw numbers, and the raw numbers
				divided by the tiles used, respectively. </p>
			<h2 id="settings-toggles">Settings / Toggles</h2>
			<p><strong>Show Initials:</strong> This option toggles whether or not the first letter of each building is
				displayed. This is designed to make it easier to distinguish buildings, but if you&#39;ve familiar with
				the color scheme you might find them annoying instead. </p>
			<p><strong>City Outline:</strong> This option toggles whether or not the city outline is shown. The red
				outline shows the maximum size of a forge of empires city, though keep in mind that at the moment a full
				city cannot be filled with the current expansions. </p>
			<p><strong>Needs Road:</strong> This option highlights all the buildings that require roads. Buildings that
				require roads will be marked in Yellow, all other buildings will be made Gray. The buildings will be
				reset to their own color when the option is turned off</p>
			<h2 id="save-load-builds">Save / Load Builds</h2>
			<p>To save the current build click the &quot;Save Build&quot; button. This will generate two methods of
				saving and sharing your build. You can copy and store the save string, either locally or in a pastebin
				file (or similar), or you can copy the share link and share that directly. Alternatively, to make the
				link easier to copy and share, shorten the full link using the likes of bit.ly or shorturl.at. At this
				stage online saving is not possible.</p>
			<p>To load a build, either paste the save string under &quot;Load Build&quot; and press the &quot;Load
				Build&quot; button, or simply open a share link.
				<strong>WARNING: Loading a build will delete the current build, make sure to save before loading a new
					build.</strong></p>
			<p>PS: To update production overview after a build is loaded simply click anywhere on the grid.</p>
			<p>Tip: Load an empty string (or refresh page) to clear the scene :)</p>
